# Algorithms and data structures

Initially created for my Algorithms' class.

Now, it works as the place to put any algorithm I want to code, just for fun.

Currently, this repository contains the following algorithms:

* [Binary to Decimal](binary-to-decimal)
* [Clustering](Conglomerate)
* [Counting Islands](islands-dfs)
* [Find Triangles in a graph](Triangles)
* [FizzBuzz](fizzbuzz)
* [Goldbach's conjeture](goldback-conjeture)
* [Kruskal](Kruskal)
* [Leetcode: Two sum](two-sum)
* [Matrix multiplication](matrix-multiplication)
* [Mergesort](mergesort)
* [Min & Max numbers](min-n-max-numbers-until-eof)
